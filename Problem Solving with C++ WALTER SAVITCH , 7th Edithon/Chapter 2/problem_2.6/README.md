# Problem 2.6: Room fire regulations program.

## Problem Statement:

>Write a program that determines whether a meeting room is in violation
of fire law regulations regarding the maximum room capacity. The program will read in the maximum room capacity and the number of people
attending the meeting. If the number of people is less than or equal to the
maximum room capacity, the program announces that it is legal to hold
the meeting and tells how many additional people may legally attend. If
the number of people exceeds the maximum room capacity, the program
announces that the meeting cannot be held as planned due to fire regulations and tells how many people must be excluded in order to meet the
fire regulations. For a harder version, write your program so that it allows
the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes. If this is a class
exercise, ask your instructor whether you should do this harder version.
