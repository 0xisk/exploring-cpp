# Problem 2.3: Annal Salary program.

## Problem Statement:

> Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive
for 6 months. Write a program that takes an employeeâ€™s previous annual
salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay due the employee, the new annual salary, and the new monthly salary. Use a variable
declaration with the modifier const to express the pay increase. Your program should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
